# Unity-Game-scripts
Unity scripts are pieces of code written in a scripting language (such as C# or UnityScript) that define the behavior and functionality of objects within a Unity game or application. These scripts are attached to game objects in the Unity Editor and control how those objects interact with the user, other objects, and the game environment.


Interactive scripts are typically written using a scripting language such as C# (Unity's primary scripting language) or JavaScript (UnityScript). These scripts are attached to game objects within the Unity Editor and define how those objects should behave and interact with the user or other objects in the scene.
